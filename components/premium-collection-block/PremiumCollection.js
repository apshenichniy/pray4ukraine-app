            My art is powerfully emotional cause itâ€™s about suffering from war. This piece symbolises a mourning and crying mother, which one can interpret to be both as a Ukrainian mother or Ukraine as whole, deeply saddened for those who have lost their lives and their loved ones.

            I have a little daughter who is inspiring me to live. The war makes me feel unsafe. And I know I can't even find a safe place for my daughter. But there are people who are taking a bigger risk. Its our army, those men and women who fight for us, surfing their lives to save our children. I hope my art will help the superheroes of our country.
